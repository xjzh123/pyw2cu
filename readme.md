# PYW2CU - Py-I want to see you

Pyw2cu means Py-I want to see you.

This is a python web app that tries to make the same basic features as "monster-revealing mirror" (照妖镜/乔碧萝你别跑), whose source code is being selled by resellers, has.

I think: with such easy function and dirty purpose, how can it be worth buying?

So, although I am not interested in capturing others' photos, I make this.

If you don't give camera permission, you can keep privacy from such websites. If you check source code, you can quickly see through them, especially mine pyw2cu (as it is a very simple web app).

It provides a panel where capture links, which take photos on being entered, can be generated. And you can also download all captured images and delete links from that panel.

It also contains a lovely remixed [WebRTC camera demo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Taking_still_photos) by MDN (get source of the original demo [here](https://github.com/mdn/samples-server)) under [cc0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).
