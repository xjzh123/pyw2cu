				This repl is made just for testing. It can automatically capture users' photographs even without alerting. It will upload image to the backend of the repl.
			</strong>

			<strong>
				The index is safe. A <a href="/console">console</a> can generate capture links, but it is just a developed demo. Don't use it to capture others' photos. Other pages may try to capture users.
